## Summary

1. Added sortable columns for tables.
2. Migrated from Recoil to Jotai for glabal state management.
3. Made the node status display optional so that it isn't shown if node status isn't configured or ready for display.
4. Caching optimizations.
   - The search results are now cached, so that the same search isn't re-run every time you navigate away from the search page.
   - Cached searches expire after an hour to prevent stale search results.
   - Updates to saved search cards, so that result counts are immediately set when saved and results are cached for an hour.
   - Saved search cards now display a time when the count was last updated. The search card is also updated whenever it is used to load a saved search.
5. Information on the ESGF-1.5 Globus Search migration available in `News`.
6. Other bug-fixes and improvements.
