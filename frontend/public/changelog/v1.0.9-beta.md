## Summary

This is the 'Globus Download' update! You now have the ability to select Globus as a download option within the data cart (for select available datasets). When downloading with Globus, you will be redirected to provide permission and to select your desired endpoint. Then you'll be able to save your endpoint as default and start the Globus download process. Since this is a brand new feature, there is a chance things will not work perfectly but we hope to address issues and make future improvements and updates as we move forward.

**Changes**

1. Added ability to download datasets (when available) through Globus.
