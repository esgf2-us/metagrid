## Summary

This is the 'Globus Transfer' update! You now have the ability to use the Globus Transfer option within the data cart (only for Globus Ready datasets). When transferring with Globus, you will be redirected to provide permission and to select your desired endpoint. Then you'll be able to save your endpoint as default and start the Globus transfer process. Since this is a brand new feature, there is a chance things will not work perfectly but we hope to address issues and make future improvements and updates as we move forward. **If you are not familiar with Globus, we highly recommend you visit the Globus website**: [https://www.globus.org/get-started](https://www.globus.org/get-started), to learn more and get started, before attempting to use the Globus transfer feature.
