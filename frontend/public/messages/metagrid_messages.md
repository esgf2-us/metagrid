## CORDEX data *not* supported

Metagrid uses an updated user accounts system.  Unfortunately for anyone looking for CORDEX data, these new accounts cannot be used to authenticate when running a CORDEX Wget script.  Please use an ESGF *legacy* OpenID obtained at any of the ESGF CoG instances listed here: https://esgf.github.io/nodes.html 

## Upcoming changes to ESGF @LLNL

We are excited to be planning to have an "official" release of the Metagrid platform onto scalable infrastructure.  In the meantime we will be testing new features.
* Globus Transfer feature planned to be released in v1.0.9.
