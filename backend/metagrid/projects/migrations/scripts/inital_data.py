CMIP6 coordinates somewhat independent model intercomparison activities and their experiments which have adopted a common infrastructure for collecting, organizing, and distributing output from models performing common sets of experiments. The simulation data produced by models under previous phases of CMIP have been used in thousands of research papers (some of which are listed here), and the multi-model results provide some perspective on errors and uncertainty in model simulations. This information has proved invaluable in preparing high profile reports assessing our understanding of climate and climate change (e.g., the IPCC Assessment Reports).",

CMIP provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access. This framework enables a diverse community of scientists to analyze GCMs in a systematic fashion, a process which serves to facilitate model improvement. Virtually the entire international climate modeling community has participated in this project since its inception in 1995. The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) archives much of the CMIP data and provides other support for CMIP. PCMDI's CMIP effort is funded by the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM) Program of the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research (BER) program.",

In part, the WGCM organized this activity to enable those outside the major modeling centers to perform research of relevance to climate scientists preparing the Fourth Asssessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Program to assess scientific information on climate change.
